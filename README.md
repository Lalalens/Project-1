## Project Description/Outline

#### Is the way the media portrays mass shootings the reality of what occurs. The media portrays mass shootings in a way that promotes a stereotype of the individuals, their background, and the weapons they use. Is this the reality or is it a false narrative? We want to look at the data for the last 25 years of mass shootings to describe the actuality of these events. 


## Research Questions to Answer

#### Is the typical profile given for the people who commit mass shootings a true representation?
#### Does the media give honest information when reporting on mass shootings?
#### Is a ban on assault weapons an effective way to stop mass shootings?
